# Socially Approaching Neighbors

## Description
Socially Approaching Neighbors (SAN) is a cooperative game where players must get as close to each other without knowing where the other exactly is. This game can be played by two or more players. Ideally, this game shouldn't be played in a way where players can see the other players' screens. This project was made as a reflection for a Social Science class.

## Mechanics

1. All players should open any modern browser (Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, etc.) and go to [ayumu098.github.io/san/](https://ayumu098.github.io/san/).

2. Players could either choose a room name and input their choice in the text field. This is optional. Note that all players must use the same room name. The room name is case and space sensitive.
3. The matrix shown is only a part a much larger matrix that all players can navigate in. Each player has a different, random starting point on the matrix. Players can press the arrow keys to move accordingly.
4. All players have an individual number of moves that they can only make. Each arrow key reduces the remaining moves by one. 
5. After all the moves are completed, the screen will show the current coordinates of the player (in horizontal, vertical).
6. The final goal for the game is to ensure all the coordinates of the player are equal (or close).

## Guide Questions
1. What ideas did each player suggest to complete the challenge?
2. How can the players be sure that they are close to each other? 
3. Would the game be easier if there were more or fewer players?
4. Is there an optimal strategy to the game or was it pure luck?
5. Are there any symbollisms you picked up from the game?
