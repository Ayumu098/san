# Socially Approaching Neighbors

## Description

Socially Approaching Neighbors (SAN) is a cooperative game where players must get as close to each other without knowing where the other exactly is. This game can be played by two or more players. Ideally, this game shouldn't be played in a way where players can see the other players' screens (but this doesn't always make the game easier). This project was made on one day as a reflection for a Social Science class, and adjusted after being graded.

## Mechanics

1. Open any modern browser and go to [ayumu098.github.io/san/](https://ayumu098.github.io/san/).
2. Optionally, the theme can be changed by selecting the colors below.
3. Choose any room name. Not inputting any text sets the room to default. Inputs are case and space sensitive. All players should have the same room name. Press enter on the input form to start the game.
4. A grid of colors is shown. Each player can only view a different portion of the grid. Press the arrow keys to move. Each player only has a limited number of moves before the game ends.
5. After the game ends, a coordinate is shown for each player. The final goal for the game is to ensure all the coordinates of the player are equal (or close).

## Guide Questions

1. What ideas did each player suggest to complete the challenge?
2. How can the players be sure that they are close to each other?
3. Would the game be easier if there were more or fewer players?
4. Is there an optimal strategy to the game or was it pure luck?
5. Are there any symbolisms in the game?
